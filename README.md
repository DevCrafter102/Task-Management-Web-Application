# Task-Management-Web-Application

---

**My Contribution**  
I developed this task management web application using Django, leveraging Python‚Äôs powerful backend capabilities to create a robust, easy-to-navigate system for managing tasks. My contributions involved both backend and frontend development, from implementing the task handling logic to creating a responsive, user-friendly interface with Bootstrap. I also integrated PostgreSQL for efficient data management and handled deployment configurations, ensuring the application‚Äôs seamless performance and scalability.

**Features and Key Functions**

- **üîë User Authentication**  
  Implemented secure user registration and login functionality, with authentication protocols that ensure all actions are performed by authorized users. This includes email verification and password security, building a foundation of trust and security for user data.

- **üìù Task Management**  
  Built out complete task management functionality, allowing users to create tasks with detailed attributes such as task name, description, and status (e.g., new, in progress, completed). Users can assign tasks to performers, track task progress, and manage deadlines, fostering team collaboration and accountability.

- **üè∑Ô∏è Labeling System**  
  Designed a flexible many-to-many relationship-based labeling system, enabling users to categorize tasks using labels such as "Bug," "Feature," or custom labels. This system empowers users to organize tasks based on project needs, improving task searchability and team focus.

- **üîç Task Filtering**  
  Implemented a comprehensive filtering mechanism that allows users to filter tasks by attributes like status, performer, label, and author. This feature provides quick insights into project status and task allocations, promoting effective task prioritization and streamlined workflows.

- **üíª Interactive Interface**  
  Leveraged Bootstrap to create a responsive and modern UI, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices. Dropdown menus, buttons, and status indicators are designed for quick access, making the interface both functional and visually appealing.

- **üìä Dashboard and Notifications**  
  Integrated a dashboard to give users an overview of ongoing tasks, completed work, and deadlines. Task notifications alert users about changes in task status, due dates, and updates, improving team alignment and task visibility.
